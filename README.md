# task 1:

In order to create a website that is both visually appealing and highly functional, I began by developing a strong foundational HTML codebase that adheres to industry best practices. This codebase was carefully crafted to ensure that it is easy to read, organized, and scalable.

Next, I designed a custom CSS code that brings the website to life with an aesthetically pleasing design that is consistent across all pages. This involved using modern design principles, such as responsive design, typography, color theory, and layout techniques, to create a professional and engaging user experience.

To ensure optimum performance, I integrated dynamic JavaScript code that provides full control over the website's behavior and interaction. This code allows users to interact with the website in a seamless and intuitive manner, while also ensuring that the website loads quickly and efficiently.

In addition to the JavaScript code, I also developed an additional JavaScript code that displays the website's results in another browser, making it easier for users to view and share their results with others.

To enhance the website's functionality even further, I also integrated PHP code that displays results from databases. This allows users to access and view information in a seamless and efficient manner, while also ensuring that the website is scalable and easy to maintain.

Overall, my approach to developing this website involved a careful balance of form and function, with a focus on creating a user-friendly experience that is both visually appealing and highly responsive.

# task 2
# this code creates a webpage with a control panel that allows you to move a robot and displays its path using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
1. HTML (index.html): 
   - This code defines the structure of the webpage using HTML elements. 
   - The <button> elements with unique IDs represent the control buttons for moving the robot in different directions (up, down, left, right). 
   - The <div id="robot"> element represents the display area for the robot. 
   - The <canvas id="plot"> element is used to draw and display the path of the robot's movement. 
   - The <script> tag at the bottom references the external JavaScript file (`script.js`) for handling the robot movement and path display. 
 
2. CSS (style.css): 
   - This code defines the styles and layout of the webpage elements. 
   - The body styles set margins, padding, and font family to be used for the entire document. 
   - The #controls styles position the control panel on the left side of the screen using absolute positioning and vertical centering. 
   - The #controls button styles set the appearance of the control buttons, such as background color, font size, and border radius. 
   - The #robot styles position the robot in the center of the screen using absolute positioning and both vertical and horizontal centering. 
   - The #plot styles position the canvas element to cover the entire webpage and set a background color. 
 
3. JavaScript (script.js): 
   - This code handles the robot movement and path display using JavaScript. 
   - It first selects the robot element and the canvas element using their IDs. 
   - The pathData array is initialized to store the coordinates of the robot's movement. 
   - The moveRobot() function is defined to handle the movement of the robot: 
     - It takes a direction parameter (up, down, left, right) as input. 
     - Depending on the direction, it updates the position of the robot (top and left CSS properties) and adds the new coordinates to the pathData array. 
     - It then clears the canvas, starts a new path, and draws the path using the stored coordinates in the pathData array. 
   - Event listeners are added to each button using addEventListener() to listen for the button click events. 
   - When a button is clicked, the corresponding direction is passed to the moveRobot() function.
